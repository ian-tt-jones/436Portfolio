        <h2>Extension</h2>
        <p>
            For this page you will see I have chosen to extend on the topic of misleading visualizations. 
            This was one of the activities that really stuck with me because I could not believe some of 
            these visualizations were actually being shown in the media. Misleading visualizations are a 
            great danger in our society because they are responsible for the spread of misinformation. 
            Authors sometimes mislead viewers by selectively presenting data and omitting relevant information or context. 

                <br><br>I have created an example visualization as an extension of this topic. With election 
                season coming up, there are a lot of ways politicians are going to try to sway voters. 
                I have made an example visualization that someone lobbying for the Democrats might use. 
            
                <div class="misleading_vis">
                <figure class="unemployment">
                    <img src="misleading_vis/2020_final_vis.png" alt="vis" style="width:550px;height:425px;">

                                The right image shows the unemployment rates for April 2024, the April of Biden's last year of his first term in office. Data gathered 
                                from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. 
                    </figcaption>

            </div>      
            <p>
                This visualization is misleading because it fails to mention the context of the high unemployment 
                rates in April 2020, which was the pandemic. A viewer could look at 
                these two comparisons and believe it was due to Trumpâ€™s actions alone in his presidency 
                that caused this high rate of unemployment, when it was really a generational pandemic 
                that put people out of work. Not considering any other factors in why someone would vote 
                for one candidate versus another, with the fast pace spread of content and misinformation, 
                a vis such as this one could be the cause of some voters to vote a certain way. People should 
                only be voting based on honest and fair comparisons.   
                <br><br>
                In addition to the general content being misleading, this scale of the coloring of the 
                map is also not proportioned evenly. The scale is made specifically to create a difference 
                between the two graphs. This is another example of how easy it is to create a misleading 
                visualization. It is up to the reader to have the skills and background knowledge to be able 
                to dissect and recognize visualizations such as the one I have created. Sadly, misleading 
                visualizations are very common in the political space. Politicians will manipulate data and 
                scales in whatever way they need to get the edge over their opponents. 
                <br><br>
                Here is a relevant example of this happening in the real world.
                The following is a tweet from Trump claiming the country has seen the greatest job gains in a 
                month under his presidency. This is somewhat true, but the important context missing is that the month 
                before the country saw the record most jobs lost in a month.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            As touched on in the previous section, I chose to extend upon this item because of how important 
            the issue of misleading visualizations is. Going through this process, I found it too easy to be 
            able to change the data and scales to how I wanted them to appear to try to fool the reader into 
            believing what I want them to believe. With more awareness and education on misleading visualizations, 
            the public can be accurately informed.
            <br><br>
            This activity taught me that you should never take any initial view of a visualization for 
            what it is; always take some time to really know what you are looking at. A challenge I encountered
            was thinking of a misleading visualization in the first place because this is not something I would 
            try to make ordinarily, but I then thought about the visualization I used for the worst bakeoff and it 
            was a political image. This is what led me to a hypothetical political image for the upcoming election.
            
            <br><br>Separate from the 
            overall concept of misleading visualizations, I did use a different tool to construct these 
            visualizations, rstudio. This taught me a whole new skill that I can apply in the future. 
            Apart from coding the visualization, I also had to do different kinds of research I had never 
            done before. Finding data for unemployment rates in 2020 and 2024 were very easy, but the hard 
            part was learning the techniques to find shapefiles of the United States with only the territories 
            I needed, followed by learning how to load in and merge the data properly using a new tool and coding 
            language, and finally figuring out how to display it in the best way possible. This process of learning 
            a new tool and doing research for data and how to work with it is a priceless skill that can be applied 
            in any professional or non professional setting. In addition, I learned a lot also by putting together the 
            web page for this activity. 
            <br><br>Some things that sparked my interest and curiosity were just the sheer amount 
            of misleading visualizations that affect people each day; who is holding people accountable for what they 
            are creating? After going through this activity I can say I am much more prepared to watch the news.
