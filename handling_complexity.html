            I chose this item for my portfolio because the visualization I chose to focus on for this activity was one of the most visually appealing and overall most impressive I had seen throughout the semester. The visualization I am referring to is the Song Repetition visualization. This visualization handles complexity in an amazing way that makes it appear simple to the user.

            <img src="handling_complexity_files/worksheet.png" alt="worksheet" style="width:450px;height:700px;">
            <br><br>
            <img src="handling_complexity_files/vis3.png" alt="vis" style="width:450px;height:700px;">
            <br><br>
            This assignment taught me about multiform views and how including multiple idioms into one visualization can lead to an amazing display of the same dataset. The Song Repetition visualization included many different multiform views including a scrollytelling section where the lyrics of different songs changed as the user scrolled. This section surprised me because I had not seen anything like it before and this eventually inspired me to include scrolly telling in my group project. In addition to scrollytelling, this visualization has interactivity which blew my mind even more, it is truly an all in one visualization. This activity in general exposed me to many different visualizations which used a lot of different techniques which I can apply to my own work in the future. These techniques, besides the ones I have listed, include using a website to incorporate multiple visualizations. This is a technique which I saw a lot of groups use for their projects which were very appealing. 
            <br><br>
            Having discovered and been exposed to so many different visualizations which handle complexity so well and diving deep into the Song Repetition visualization, I now feel more prepared to handle complexity with tasks in the future whether it is a visualization or another piece of work. I learned you need to break the data down into smaller steps and brainstorm different ways it can be displayed. This skill can be applied anywhere in my future work. Seeing how much the author was able to display on such a broad and complex topic taught me that things that seem impossible are much easier once you break them down. 
            <br><br>
            This activity sparked my curiosity as to what other kinds of visualizations are out there and if they are on topics I am passionate about. Reflecting on this activity has also inspired me to want to create beautiful visualizations of my own and use them to present data in the future. The skills and knowledge I have gained from this are priceless.
