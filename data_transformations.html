        <p>
            I chose to include the activity on Data and Task Abstraction because it is one of the more memorable for me from the semester. This activity was one of the first where we were diving into some real world data and it was a great learning experience and a nice way to get my hands dirty early on. I also enjoyed the part of the activity where we explored data transformations of the data. I have worked with transforming raw data for professional use in the past and it was enjoyable to get back into thinking about data transformations. 
            <br><br>
            This activity taught me how to recognize dataset and attribute types, which was very important to learn early in this course. I am not sure if I entirely got it down the first time I did this activity looking at the first page, but after discussing my work with my groupmates things became much clearer. I learned how to tell the difference between different dataset types such as tabular, text, image as well as recognizing their attributes. In this example in particular we were working with a table of data which told the reader which countries were receiving and donating the most aid. The most influential technique I learned from this activity was how to generate data analysis questions and transform data. Being able to generate these questions and know how to transform the data is crucial for creating effective visualizations. Later in the activity when we were studying the different visualizations of the data, I was surprised by how many different ways there were to represent and transform the data.

            <br><br>
            I will use the concepts and techniques I learned from this activity outside of class whenever I am studying or creating a visualization. If I am watching the news, making a chart for work, or just browsing the internet, I now know how to recognize and separate the different parts of a visualization. If I do data analysis work in my future career, these techniques will help me know how I need to transform my data. For example, I am able to recognize what attribute type needs to be highlighted for different data (categorical, quantitative, ordinal). This is a very important concept because different datasets require different attribute types to be shown. In terms of data transformations, being able to switch from ordinal to quantitative and vice versa is vital in the research field. For example, in one visualization we may be interested in specific values (quantitative), but a lot of the time it can make more sense to a reader to see data grouped ordinally. My group ended up needing to use these techniques for our sports injuries visualization. 
            <br><br>
            This activity sparked a lot of interest and curiosity for me. As I was studying this dataset and looking over the different visualizations that came with it, I started to realize just how infinite this field of computer science is. There are countless datasets in existence as well as data being collected everyday and learning how many different ways data can be displayed and transformed is crazy to think about. I remember at the beginning of the class Dr. Williams highlighted how this course is also about creativity, and doing this activity showed that. Being able to create a visualization is only limited by our own minds.
